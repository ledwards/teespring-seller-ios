# Teespring Seller iOS

## Description
[Teespring](https://www.teespring.com) is a platform where anyone can create custom apparel and other merchandise and sell it online. We handle the manufacturing and distribution, and sellers handle design and marketing. Our top sellers generate tons of traffic through paid advertising on platforms like Facebook, and make real-time decisions about ad spend using limited information from our website's seller dashboard. The Teespring Seller iOS app is a way for sellers to have access to their data on the go, so they can make decisions about their business from anywhere.
